Temperature Unit Convertor

   -> I have build this temperature unit convertor as a desktop appliction to convert Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius,Kelvin or vice-versa.
   
   -> It is based on GUI app , built using QT/QML and C++ as backend support.
   
   -> You have to enter any temperature value whether Fahrenheit, Celsius, or Kelvin then click on another textbox it will gives other values in their respective textbox.
   
   Testing
   
   -> For testing the desktop application I have used Windows Inspect Tool for automation testing, data driven testing.
